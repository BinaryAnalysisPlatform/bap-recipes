Note. Delete this message after you read it! If bap fails with an error, you have problems with installation, or need feedback, please use our main issue tracker. We reserve this one to track issues with tools capabilities. In the title, substitute:
- <tool> - with a tool name, e.g., av-rule-17
- <arch> - architecture of the target binary (the one being analyzed), e.g., arm
- <os> - the operating system for which the binary is compiled, if known, e.g., linux
- <env> - the environment for which the binary is compiled, if known, e.g., gnu
- <abi> - the abi that the target binary, if known, e.g., eabi
- <false-positive-or-negative>? - if the tools is not reporting an incident when there is one, then write false-negative, if it reports an incident in a benign case, write false-positive, other wise use other-problem. 

Here is an example of a title,
```
av-rule-17 arm-linux-gnueabi false-negative
```

1. What incidents are expected to be reported, in case of a false negative, or what incidents are reported but are not expected? What are the presumed locations of the weaknesses in the binary?

2. Upload the binary if possible.

3.  Upload all files generated by the check, i.e., `log` files, `incidents`, `stdout`, `stderr`, etc (some may be missing depending on a tool)

Additional Information
=================

1. The output of the following commands:
```
bap --version
bap --llvm-version
bap list plugins
