detects a double call to 'free' on the same memory address

This check covers CWE-415 Double Free entry.

Motivation
==========

Calling 'free' twice on the same address can crash the program.
Also, in some cases, it could cause two subsequent calls to
'malloc' to return the same pointer, which potentially can
give an atacker a control over the data written into this memory.
