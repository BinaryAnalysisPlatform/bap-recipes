detects an unused result of a function with warn-unused-result attribute

Ensures the usage of a value returned by a function
that is tagged wih the GNU warn-unused-result attribute.


The Algorithm
================

We use taint analysis and propagate taint from output argument
of a function that has warn-unused attribute.
The taint can be sanitized (and therefore, the argument is used)
in the next two cases:

1) if control flow depends from the tainted value, i.e.
   a taint reached a condition in a jump term

2) taint reached an external function, i.e. it's in the rhs
   of a callsite of such function.

Once taint has never reached one of these points, we consider
an source argument is unused. **)
