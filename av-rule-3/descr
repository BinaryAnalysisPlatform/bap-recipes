All functions shall have a cyclomatic complexity number of 20 or less.

The cyclomatic complexity number is a metric that is used to determine a
number of linearly independent paths in a subroutine control flow graph (CFG).
The number is computed using the following formula,

  C = E - N + P
  
where `E` is the number of edges, `N` is the number of nodes, and `P` is
the number of strongly connected components. The CFG exit node is connected
to its entry node, so that an acyclic function will have one connected component. 

The threshold 20 is a parameter.
